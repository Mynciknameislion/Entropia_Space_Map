# Entropia_Space_Map
 A rip of the entropia universe space map, this is not my own code
I have simply downloaded all the dependencies for full offline usage.
This is for archiving purposes only and I in no way claim ownership 
of this map or its source code or its dependecies, the real online 
version can at the time of writing be found at http://absolutelyanythingelse.com/entropiaspacemap/

To use this simply download the repository and launch it using the 
index.html file and it should open or try to open in your browser.
